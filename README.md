# Bluetooth SumoBot
The firmware and controller code for a differential drive mini-robot that can move forward/backward and turn. 

To control the robot, the user starts the Python script and connects to the robot using Bluetooth. After doing so, they may control the robot either using their keyboard (WASD) or any game controller supported by Pygame.

This was made as a group project for my TEJ4M0 course in high school.
